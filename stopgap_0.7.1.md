STOPGAP 0.7.1
STOPGAP is a subtomogram averaging workflow written in MATLAB for
 performing a number of subtomogram averaging tasks including 
template matching, high-resolution alignment and averaging, and 
classification. STOPGAP has been rewritten from scratch and is no 
longer compatible with TOM/AV3-style files; it now uses its own 
.star files. 


Supplied is the source code, a set of example bash scripts, and 
instructions on how to compile and run STOPGAP. Pre-compiled 
binaries are also supplied; these were compiled using MATLAB R2015b.
